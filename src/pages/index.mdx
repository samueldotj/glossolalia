# Speaking in Tongues in Church
This article explains the conditions that is needed to guide the corporate worship as described by word of God.

----
### 1 Corinthians 14
> **27** If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two or at the most three, and each in turn, and one must interpret;
> **28** but if there is no interpreter, he must keep silent in the church; and let him speak to himself and to God.


:::danger[Did you know above verses are a commandment?]
Paul makes it absolutely clear that the instructions in 1 Corinthians 14 are not suggestions or cultural recommendations, but commandments of the Lord.
1 Corinthians 14:37 – **"If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord's commandment."**.
So, the instructions in verses 27–28 are binding commands from the Holy Spirit for how the gift of tongues must be used in the church gathering.
1 Corinthians 14:40 gives the reason for this commandment: “Let all things be done decently and in order.”

        In your church does, the following conditions are taken as word of God?  

        ✅ Only two or three  
        ✅ One at a time  
        ✅ With interpretation  
        ❌ Without interpretation
    </TabItem>


    <TabItem value="private" label="Private">
        1 Corinthians 14:27-28 deals with the proper order for speaking in tongues within a church gathering. 
        These verses do not address speaking in tongues during private prayer or in one’s personal devotion at home. 
        This is evident from the larger context in 1 Cor 14:4, 19 and 23. 
        These verses guide corporate worship and are not intended to **prohibit private prayer in tongues**.

# Objections and Answers

<QBox title="What you think 1 Corinthians 14 means?">
### How many can speak in tongues in the Church?  
    At most three people may speak in tongues during a service, and only one at a time (v27). The fourth person disobeys the commandment of the Holy Spirit (v37).

### How do I know how many people have spoken in tongues in Church?  
    If a person is speaking in tongues loud enough to be heard, that counts. Silent or private praying in tongues is not what this verse refers to.

### Someone spoke in tongues without interpretation. Can I still speak if I'm only the second person?  
    Possibly not. If the first person disobeyed verse 28 by speaking without an interpreter, continuing the pattern may also be disobedience.
</QBox>


<QBox title="Have you not read Acts?">
### In Acts 19, twelve people spoke in tongues. So why only 2 or 3 in a Church?  
    Acts 19 was a special moment during Paul’s evangelism and church planting in Ephesus. 1 Corinthians 14 applies to established church gatherings, not baptism or evangelistic events.

### In Acts 10, everyone spoke in tongues. So, can the whole Church do the same today?  
    No. Acts 10 was about the initial outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the Gentiles in a home, not a regular church meeting.

### In Acts 2, 120 people spoke in tongues. Why restrict in Church?   
    Acts 2:6 shows they spoke in known languages understood by others. This was an evangelistic sign for unbelievers. The Holy Spirit through Paul encourages such tongues (understood by hearers), but restricts uninterpreted tongues in church.
</QBox>

<QBox title="word of God is important than the direct experience?">

### Don’t Spirit-filled churches encourage tongues in worship?  
    Not without interpretation and order. For example, the Assemblies of God (AG)—the largest Pentecostal denomination—teaches: “Final responsibility for giving an interpretation of tongues in a public assembly rests with the one who gave the utterance in tongues. The speaker either must be assured that someone else in the assembly will provide the interpretation, or he must be prepared to do so himself (1 Corinthians 14:13, 27 28).” (Source: AG official website)

### What if a Spirit-anointed person says tongues edify the Church—even without interpretation?  
    Then you must choose between the “Word of man” or the “Word of God”. God anticipated this and said:
    > **1 Corinthians 14:37** – “If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that what I write to you is the Lord’s commandment.”
    Also, consider: Mormons claim they got new revelation from Saints beyond the Bible. (That is why they are called Latter Day Saints) Do you believe their extra books too?

### But I’ve seen churches grow financially while speaking in tongues. Isn’t that God's blessing?  
    Growth or wealth is not proof of God's approval. For example, the United Pentecostal Church International (UPCI) grew financially—yet they deny the Trinity and teach heresy. They may speak in tongues, but they do not follow the Spirit, because they disobey God's Word. God may allow material growth as a judgment (Romans 1:28). True spirituality aligns with Scripture, not just emotion or experience.

### What’s wrong with everyone edifying themselves by speaking in tongues together? 
    Because it violates God’s explicit command (v37). We see examples from Exodus 30:9 and Leviticus 10:1. If God commanded, just don’t second guess it. Obedience is better than ritual or what seems spiritual (1 Sam 15:22).

<QBox title="What about verse X?">

### What about verse 2?  
    Verse 2 emphasizes that unknown tongues should not be broadcasted (e.g., on a microphone). See question 4.

### What about praying in spirit (verse 14-15)?  
    In v14, Paul says that public prayers in an unknown tongue are “unfruitful”. Fruit-bearing is a crucial Christian value (John 15:1–7), and therefore the prospect of being unfruitful should be a great concern. V15 says the legitimacy of a person’s speech in the midst of the congregation is measured by the edification it brings the body of Christ. Speeches, prayers of blessing, and expressions of thanksgiving cannot edify the body (church) if they are unintelligible. Paul’s statement, *I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with my understanding*, means he will pray in a way that is both intelligible to bystanders and drawn from his spirit.

### What about Paul speaking more than all (v18)?  
    Yes—but not in the church. See verse 19 for the clarification.

### What does "let him speak to himself and to God" (v28) mean?  
    It does not mean continuing to speak audibly to yourself. In everyday life, people rarely talk to themselves out loud in public. Linguistically, it means: Speaking silently or in a low voice not meant to be heard. In this context: the person may continue spiritually, but not disturb the assembly.

<QBox title="Is it truly a commandment?">

### Is it truly a commandment? (since v34 says women should not speak which seems to be unreasonable?)
    If God says it, we must obey—even when we don’t fully understand or it seems unreasonable. However, verse 34 refers to questioning a prophet (see context: v29). God is not forbidding women from praying, prophesying, or singing in church (which are allowed in vv. 26–31), but from participating in public evaluation of prophecy. For example, women should not interrupt or correct sermons during the assembly but can do so privately (see Acts 18:26—Priscilla corrected Apollos outside a public setting).

### Is it truly a commandment? (Since “two or at most three” in v27 sound vague - Wouldn’t a command have a fixed number?)  
    This is a normal linguistic way of setting a limit. The phrase means “no more than three”, not a requirement for exactly three. This style is consistent with other scriptures—e.g., Matthew 18:16: “...by the evidence of two or three witnesses.”

### Do you follow all new testament commandments since most of them does not apply today?
    Yes – Christians should follow all of God’s commandments since not an iota would be removed till the end of ages. Luckily the New Testament lists only 3 commandments – Love God, Love others and keep worship order. See [Appendix - New Testament Commandments](commandments) for details.

# About

<QBox>
My journey with this topic began as an observer. I saw many Christians speak in tongues in church without interpretation and accepted it as normal. It wasn't until I was born again and began reading the Bible seriously that I discovered 1 Corinthians 14:27-28, which gave me pause.

The gap between what I was reading in Scripture and what I was seeing in church created a deep burden. When I sought answers from fellow believers, I hoped for a Bible-based explanation. Instead, I was met with objections that lacked scriptural support. This led me to create this resource: a compilation of common objections and my scriptural responses. My goal is to seek truth and encourage obedience to God's Word.   

I know this can be a difficult topic, especially for those who have practiced speak in tongues in church for a long time. 
If you have questions after reading, I welcome a discussion. 
If you think some brother or preacher or pastor can provide clarity on this, please send them this link.
