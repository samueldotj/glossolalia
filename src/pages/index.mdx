# Speaking in Tongues in Church
This article explains the conditions that is needed to guide the corporate worship as described by word of God.

----
# Word of God
> **1 Corinthians 14:27** If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by two or at the most three, and each in turn, and one must interpret;
> **28** but if there is no interpreter, he must keep silent in the church; and let him speak to himself and to God.

## Application

<QBox>

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="church" label="Church">
        Here are the rules given by Holy Spirit to guide the worship order in the Church.

        ✅ Only two or three  
        ✅ One at a time  
        ✅ With interpretation  
        ❌ Without interpretation
    </TabItem>


    <TabItem value="private" label="Private">
        1 Corinthians 14:27-28 deals with the proper order for speaking in tongues within a church gathering. 
        These verses do not address speaking in tongues during private prayer or in one’s personal devotion at home. 
        This is evident from the larger context in 1 Cor 14:4, 19 and 23. 
        These verses guide corporate worship and are not intended to **prohibit private prayer in tongues**.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>



:::danger[Did you know that the above worship order is a commandment?]
Paul makes it absolutely clear that the instructions in 1 Corinthians 14 are not suggestions or cultural recommendations, but commandments of the Lord.
1 Corinthians 14:37 – **"If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the Lord's commandment."**.
So, the instructions in verses 27–28 are binding commands from the Holy Spirit for how the gift of tongues must be used in the church gathering.
1 Corinthians 14:40 gives the reason for this commandment: “Let all things be done decently and in order.”

:::

<QBox title="Practice">
### How many can speak in tongues in the Church?  
    At most three people may speak in tongues during a service, and only one at a time (v27). **The fourth person disobeys the commandment of the Holy Spirit (v37)**.

### How do I know how many people have spoken in tongues in Church?  
    If a person is speaking in tongues **loud enough to be heard**, that counts. Silent or private praying in tongues is not what this verse refers to.

### Someone spoke in tongues without interpretation. Can I still speak if I'm only the second person?  
    If the first person disobeyed verse 28 by speaking without an interpreter, continuing the pattern may also be disobedience.

# Understanding the misunderstanding

For a Christian who observes a modern-day "Corinthian-style" church in their neighborhood, it may seem obvious that those participating in such a service either do not read Scripture carefully or interpret it incorrectly.
However, for many believers who practice speaking in tongues during church services, this perspective may be difficult to accept. They might instead believe that those who criticize such practices are the ones misinterpreting Scripture.
This disagreement is understandable. To help clarify the issue, the following **interactive decision tree** has been created. It presents a series of questions designed to identify where misunderstandings in reading or interpreting Scripture may occur.
Please take your time answering each question thoughtfully. If you have any comments or concerns, feel free to add them in the comment box below.

# Objections

<QBox title="Have you not read Acts?" defaultCollapsed>
#### In Acts 19, twelve people spoke in tongues. So why only 2 or 3 in a Church?  
    Acts 19 was a special moment during Paul’s evangelism and church planting in Ephesus. 1 Corinthians 14 applies to established church gatherings, not baptism or evangelistic events.

#### In Acts 10, everyone spoke in tongues. So, can the whole Church do the same today?  
    No. Acts 10 was about the initial outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the Gentiles in a home, not a regular church meeting.

#### In Acts 2, 120 people spoke in tongues. Why restrict in Church?   
    Acts 2:6 shows they spoke in known languages understood by others. This was an evangelistic sign for unbelievers. The Holy Spirit through Paul encourages such tongues (understood by hearers), but restricts uninterpreted tongues in church.
</QBox>

<QBox title="Don't you obey word of gifted spiritual person(s) or churches?" defaultCollapsed>
### Pray and goto this preacher who is spiritually gifted and anointed. He is a prophet. Please listen to his word.  
    If someone cannot explain their point using Scripture and instead relies on personal allegories or myths, then we are faced with a choice: the word of man or the Word of God. As for me, I will always choose the Word of God.
    > **1 Corinthians 14:37** – “If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that what I write to you is the Lord’s commandment.”

#### Don’t Spirit-filled churches encourage tongues in worship?  
    Not without interpretation and order. For example, the Assemblies of God (AG)—the largest Pentecostal denomination—teaches: “Final responsibility for giving an interpretation of tongues in a public assembly rests with the one who gave the utterance in tongues. The speaker either must be assured that someone else in the assembly will provide the interpretation, or he must be prepared to do so himself (1 Corinthians 14:13, 27 28).” (Source: AG official website)

#### But I’ve seen churches grow financially while speaking in tongues. Isn’t that God's blessing?  
    Growth or wealth is not proof of God's approval. For example, the United Pentecostal Church International (UPCI) grew financially—yet they deny the Trinity and teach heresy. They may speak in tongues, but they do not follow the Spirit, because they disobey God's Word. God may allow material growth as a judgment (Romans 1:28). True spirituality aligns with Scripture, not just emotion or experience.

#### What’s wrong with everyone edifying themselves by speaking in tongues together? 
    Because it violates God’s explicit command (v37). We see examples from Exodus 30:9 and Leviticus 10:1. If God commanded, just don’t second guess it. Obedience is better than ritual or what seems spiritual (1 Sam 15:22).

</QBox>

<QBox title="What about verse X?" defaultCollapsed>

#### What about verse 2?  
    Verse 2 emphasizes that unknown tongues should not be broadcasted (e.g., on a microphone). See question 4.

#### What about praying in spirit (verse 14-15)?  
    In v14, Paul says that public prayers in an unknown tongue are “unfruitful”. Fruit-bearing is a crucial Christian value (John 15:1–7), and therefore the prospect of being unfruitful should be a great concern. V15 says the legitimacy of a person’s speech in the midst of the congregation is measured by the edification it brings the body of Christ. Speeches, prayers of blessing, and expressions of thanksgiving cannot edify the body (church) if they are unintelligible. Paul’s statement, *I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with my understanding*, means he will pray in a way that is both intelligible to bystanders and drawn from his spirit.

#### What about Paul speaking more than all (v18)?  
    Yes—but not in the church. See verse 19 for the clarification.

#### What does "let him speak to himself and to God" (v28) mean?  
    It does not mean continuing to speak audibly to yourself. In everyday life, people rarely talk to themselves out loud in public. Linguistically, it means: Speaking silently or in a low voice not meant to be heard. In this context: the person may continue spiritually, but not disturb the assembly.

#### Is it possible that 'in the church' (v. 28) refers only to the formal, sermon-focused part of the gathering, and not to periods of open worship or prayer?
    The context of 1 Corinthians 14 covers the entire meeting of the assembly. Verse 26 says, "When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation." This describes a participatory and varied service, not just a formal sermon. The overarching command is that "All things must be done for building up" (v. 26) and "decently and in order" (v. 40). Creating a "rule-free" segment of the service for disorderly worship goes against the entire spirit and purpose of Paul's instruction for the corporate gathering.

</QBox>


<QBox title="Is it truly a commandment?" defaultCollapsed>

#### Is it truly a commandment? (since v34 says women should not speak which seems to be unreasonable?)
    If God says it, we must obey—even when we don’t fully understand or it seems unreasonable. However, verse 34 refers to questioning a prophet (see context: v29). God is not forbidding women from praying, prophesying, or singing in church (which are allowed in vv. 26–31), but from participating in public evaluation of prophecy. For example, women should not interrupt or correct sermons during the assembly but can do so privately (see Acts 18:26—Priscilla corrected Apollos outside a public setting).

#### Is it truly a commandment? (Since “two or at most three” in v27 sound vague - Wouldn’t a command have a fixed number?)  
    This is a normal linguistic way of setting a limit. The phrase means “no more than three”, not a requirement for exactly three. This style is consistent with other scriptures—e.g., Matthew 18:16: “...by the evidence of two or three witnesses.”

#### Do you follow all new testament commandments since most of them does not apply today?
    Yes – Christians should follow all of God’s commandments since not an iota would be removed till the end of ages. Luckily the New Testament lists only 3 commandments – Love God, Love others and keep worship order. See [Appendix - New Testament Commandments](commandments) for details.
</QBox>

<QBox title="Arguments from Personal Experience and Emotion" defaultCollapsed>

#### I was saved in a church where everyone spoke in tongues at once. Was that experience invalid?
Your salvation is a gracious gift from God, and it is absolutely valid. God in His sovereignty can draw someone to Himself in any environment. However, we must be careful not to validate a church's practices based on our personal experience. A genuine conversion does not automatically endorse every doctrine or practice of the church where it happened. The Bible remains our ultimate standard for worship and practice. We should be thankful for our salvation while also being willing to align our form of worship with the clear instructions of Scripture.

#### Our church has seen incredible miracles and growth, yet we don't follow these rules. Isn't that fruit a sign of God's approval?
While growth and miracles can be signs of God's blessing, they are not the ultimate test of correct doctrine or practice. The Corinthian church itself was rich in spiritual gifts (1 Corinthians 1:7) yet was simultaneously corrected for disorderly worship. The true fruit God seeks is obedience born of love (John 14:15). God may graciously bless a church because of its heart for Him, while still requiring it to reform its practices to come into full alignment with His written Word.

#### Restricting this gift feels like putting God in a box. Shouldn't we allow the Spirit to move freely as He wishes?
This is an understandable sentiment, but the "box" is not one we created; it is the order God Himself designed for His own worship. The Holy Spirit authored the Scriptures, and He will never move in a way that contradicts the very rules He inspired. True freedom in the Spirit is not chaotic expression, but joyful submission to the perfect and peaceful order God has commanded (1 Corinthians 14:33, 40). These instructions don't limit the Spirit; they unleash His work in the most edifying and effective way for the entire church body.

#### When I speak in tongues publicly, I feel an incredible sense of spiritual release and victory. Why would God want to take that away from me in a church setting?
The personal edification you feel is biblical (1 Corinthians 14:4). However, the primary purpose of a church gathering is not individual experience, but the building up of the entire community (1 Corinthians 14:12, 26). Paul teaches that love "does not seek its own" (1 Corinthians 13:5). God does not want to take away your experience; He simply directs it to its proper place—private devotion. In the public assembly, He calls you to prioritize what builds up everyone, which is why He commands that all things be done with understanding.

</QBox>

<QBox title="Arguments about the Purpose of Spiritual Gifts" defaultCollapsed>

#### Since tongues is a prayer language, what's wrong with the whole congregation praying to God at the same time in the Spirit?
The problem is not the prayer itself, but the context of the public church assembly. Paul specifically addresses this scenario. He warns that if an unbeliever or an uninformed person comes in while everyone is speaking in tongues, "will they not say that you are out of your minds?" (1 Corinthians 14:23). This brings confusion and dishonors the witness of the church. The principle is clear: public worship must be intelligible and orderly. Corporate prayer should be done in a way that demonstrates the peace and order of God, not chaos.

#### What if the purpose of the tongue is spiritual warfare? Couldn't a corporate, untranslated utterance be a unified attack against demonic forces?
The Bible never prescribes corporate, uninterpreted speaking in tongues as a method for spiritual warfare. The primary purpose of gifts exercised *in the church gathering*, according to 1 Corinthians 14, is the edification and building up of the saints present (v. 3, 12, 26). While spiritual warfare is a real and important aspect of the Christian life, our weapons are described in Ephesians 6 as truth, righteousness, the gospel of peace, faith, and the Word of God—all of which require understanding. We must practice warfare as the Bible commands, not by inventing methods that contradict the rules for church conduct.

#### The Bible says 'eagerly desire the greater gifts' (1 Cor 12:31). By focusing so much on rules for one gift, aren't we missing the point of seeking more impactful ones like prophecy?
This point actually supports the article's argument. Paul's instruction to desire greater gifts leads directly into his explanation in chapter 14 of *why* prophecy is greater than tongues *in the church*—because it is understandable and edifies everyone. Following the rules for tongues is not a distraction from seeking greater gifts; it *is* the application of that principle. It is how we put tongues in its proper, God-given place and demonstrate that we truly value the more edifying gifts, like prophecy, which build up the whole church.

# About

<QBox>
My journey with this topic began as an observer. I saw many Christians speak in tongues in church without interpretation and accepted it as normal. It wasn't until I was born again and began reading the Bible seriously that I discovered 1 Corinthians 14:27-28, which gave me pause.

The gap between what I was reading in Scripture and what I was seeing in church created a deep burden. When I sought answers from fellow believers, I hoped for a Bible-based explanation. Instead, I was met with objections that lacked scriptural support. This led me to create this resource: a compilation of common objections and my scriptural responses. My goal is to seek truth and encourage obedience to God's Word.   

I know this can be a difficult topic, especially for those who have practiced speak in tongues in church for a long time. 
However, we need to put word of God first.
If you think, a gifted spiritual person can explain this away please forward to this link.
